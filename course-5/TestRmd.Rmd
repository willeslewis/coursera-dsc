My First R Markdown File 
========================


This is my first R markdown file.  

Here, we're going to load some data.  

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit<-lm(Ozone~Wind+Solar.R+Temp,data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's and unordered list:

*First element

*Second element
